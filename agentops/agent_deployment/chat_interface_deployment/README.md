# Databricks Chatbot Application

A modern, responsive chat interface that connects to Databricks AI serving endpoints, built with Dash and Python.

## Features

- Easy deployment as a Databricks App
- Real-time chat interactions with Databricks AI models
- Ability to collect user feedback on the responses
    - Thumbs up / Thumbs down
    - Additional feedback

## Deployment

This app is deployed as part of the Databricks Asset Bundle.

### Step 1: Deploy the Bundle

```bash
databricks bundle deploy -t dev
```

This will:
- ✅ Create/update the app definition in the workspace
- ✅ Sync the app source code
- ✅ Configure environment variables (SERVING_ENDPOINT)

### Step 2: Start the App

**Important**: Bundle deploy does NOT automatically start the app. You must start it manually:

```bash
# Option 1: Using Databricks CLI
databricks apps start agentops-chatbot-app-dev

# Option 2: Using the Workspace UI
# Navigate to Workspace > Apps > [your app name] > Click "Start"
```

### App Name Pattern

The app name follows this pattern: `{project_name}-chatbot-app-{target}`

Examples:
- Dev: `agentops-chatbot-app-dev`
- Staging: `agentops-chatbot-app-staging`
- Prod: `agentops-chatbot-app-prod`

### Verifying Deployment

After starting the app, check its status:

```bash
# Check app status
databricks apps get agentops-chatbot-app-dev

# View app logs (if needed)
databricks apps logs agentops-chatbot-app-dev
```
